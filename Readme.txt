#How To Deploy my project
    * First Download Visual studio on web browser
    * Go to open file then attach the project file then 
    * Add the given vercel.json file in your backend directory first: Adding this file will enable Vercel configuration.
    * Deploy server-side i.e : backend of your Waitlist Application: Go to web Vercel dashboard and click on the "Add new" button and          select the "project" category.
    * Import Your Git repository after linking your Github account with Vercel
    * Configure the Node.js backend of your MERN app: 
     -> Write your project name. For eg.Waitlist application
     -> Select "Other" in the framework option. This will ensure that the setup and customization process will be specific to Node.js.
     -> Choose the server directory of your project where the build command will be run by Vercel.
     -> Add your environmental variables. For eg. MONGO_ATLAS_URL: my-mongo-atlas-url
     -> Click on the "Deploy" button
NOTE : Don't forget to save the deployment link of your server and replace it in your code wherever the local server link was     
       provided

Most Important : In Our Waitlist Application
     you will be receiving an email, which contains an url. The url contains an localhost. 
     you have to replace the localhost by the IP address of the device which you used to deploy.
